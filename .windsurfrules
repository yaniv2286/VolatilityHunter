 VolatilityHunter Operational Rules
 MUST follow these rules during every session to ensure code quality and prevent automation crashes

## Testing Protocol - MANDATORY AFTER EVERY CHANGE
 After any code enhancement or development, you MUST run ALL three test suites in order:
 1. python lightning_tests.py      (1-2 seconds - Core functionality validation)
 2. python quick_tests.py           (0.5 seconds - Unit tests with mocking)
# 3. python quick_test_runner.py     (<30 seconds - Comprehensive validation)
#
# These tests verify:
# - Core components are working (Portfolio, Strategy, Email, Data Loader)
# - Dry run functionality is operational
# - Portfolio updates correctly
# - Risk management is active
# - Email formatting is ASCII-only
# - All integrations are functional
#
# ONLY proceed if all tests pass. If any test fails, fix the issue before continuing.

## Full System Test (Optional - for major changes)
# For significant changes, also run:
# - run_neural_venv.bat fetch        (10 minutes - Full production test)
# - run_neural_venv.bat report       (Generates comprehensive report)

## Log Verification
# After running tests, you MUST scan logs for:
# - UnicodeEncodeError
# - PermissionError  
# - Any Traceback
# - Exit code must be 0

## ASCII Only - CRITICAL
# Never use Unicode emojis in prints or logs
# Use ASCII tags like [OK], [ERROR], [SIGNAL], [BUY], [SELL], [PORTFOLIO]
# This ensures Task Scheduler compatibility

## Definition of Done
# A task is only finished when:
# 1. All three quick test suites pass (lightning_tests.py, quick_tests.py, quick_test_runner.py)
# 2. Scripts run with Exit Code 0
# 3. Logs are clean (no errors, no Unicode issues)
# 4. Portfolio state is valid and updating
# 5. Dry run executes successfully
# 6. You must confirm test results in the chat

## Quality Gates - ENFORCE STRICTLY
# - All code changes require testing (run all 3 test suites)
# - All logs must be verified for errors
# - No Unicode characters in output (ASCII only)
# - Exit code 0 is mandatory for completion
# - Portfolio must update correctly
# - Email notifications must work
# - Risk management must be active

## Test Suite Details
# lightning_tests.py:
#   - Duration: 1-2 seconds
#   - Tests: 8 core functionality checks
#   - Coverage: Imports, Files, Portfolio, Strategy, Email, Data, Risk, Performance
#
# quick_tests.py:
#   - Duration: 0.5 seconds
#   - Tests: 10 unit tests with mocking
#   - Coverage: Portfolio logic, Strategy signals, Email formatting, Integration
#
# quick_test_runner.py:
#   - Duration: <30 seconds
#   - Tests: System health + all quick tests
#   - Coverage: Complete system validation

## Workflow After Code Changes
# 1. Make code changes
# 2. Run: python lightning_tests.py
# 3. Run: python quick_tests.py
# 4. Run: python quick_test_runner.py
# 5. Verify all tests pass
# 6. Check logs for errors
# 7. Confirm in chat
# 8. ONLY THEN mark task as complete

## Emergency Protocol
# If tests fail:
# 1. Do NOT proceed with other changes
# 2. Fix the failing test immediately
# 3. Re-run all three test suites
# 4. Verify fix in logs
# 5. Document what was fixed
